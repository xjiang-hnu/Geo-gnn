 In this example, we used Colab to retrain the Geo-GNN model at S(q,t)=0.8. To save training time, we trained for only about 100 epochs and used a faster learning rate decay strategy (the learning rate halves after every 20 epochs). Here, the obtained Pearson correlation coefficient at S(q,t)=0.8 is 0.788. You can get higher results by increasing the training time and changing the learning rate decay strategy.
